## Overview
Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification Project, where we use the power of Random Forest to classify Iris flowers into three distinct species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This machine learning model explores the characteristics of each flower and predicts its species based on four key features. üåº

## Dataset
- Source: Iris dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv)
- ‚ùÅ Features:Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
- ‚ùÅTarget Classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

This dataset contains 150 observations, each corresponding to one of the three Iris species, with the goal of accurately classifying them based on the provided attributes.

## Key Features
Machine Learning Algorithm:
Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. It's well-known for handling complex datasets and minimizing overfitting.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

## Algorithms Implemented
- Random Forest

## Performance Metrics
To ensure the model is both accurate and efficient, the following metrics are used:

- Accuracy: Measures how often the model predicts correctly.
- Precision: The proportion of correct positive predictions.
- Recall: The ability of the model to correctly identify positive instances.
- F1 Score: Balances precision and recall for a more holistic evaluation.
- Confusion Matrix: A visual representation of the model's classification results, highlighting true vs predicted values.

## Visualization
- Confusion Matrix: Displayed in a heatmap format for easy analysis, helping to identify any misclassifications and the areas for improvement.
